# Make sure Git is installed

How do you know? 

* Have you installed it?
* Go to RStudio > Preferences > Git/SVN - are there paths to executables?
    * This can also be checked / setup using Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN

# Make a new project

Two ways to do this:

1. In upper left corner, click on the +R cube thingy
2. In upper right corner, click on the project icon (again, the R cube thing) and select "New Project"

# Version control the new project

In the project menu, select "Project Options ...". Then select "Git/SVN" and then "Version Control System" -> "Git"

# Practice

Make a new file. Save it. Go to the "Git" tab in the upper left quadrant of RStudio.
